Git is distributed, every directory on every computer has a working copy of the code with a complete history of changes and full version tracking capabilities.</p> <p>To define it in a more fun way, Git is a multidimensional time machine! It allows you to go back in time and see what your code looked like at a certain point in time. It also allows you to collaborate with others and work on the same codebase without stepping on each other's toes.</p> <p>But what is version control?</p>"},{"location":"workshop/#version-control","title":"Version Control","text":"<p>Let's say you are working on completing your Math-II Assignment, which requires you to write code to do some math stuff. As you keep writing your amazing code, you notice that you have to keep track of the code changes you write, so that you could come back to an old version if you mess up. As you might not be aware about VCS then, you decided to create multiple copies of your files (as shown below) to keep track of your changes.</p> <p>Now you are writing the report for this project, the same situation arises, but this time you can use Google Docs' version history feature to go back in time and get your report back. This is a great example of version control.</p> <p> </p>"},{"location":"workshop/#so-what-is-github","title":"So what is GitHub?","text":"<p>Git is to GitHub like a car is to car parking, a video is to YouTube, a photo is to Instagram. GitHub is simply a platform built to store Git repositories (folders), which allows you to store your code in the cloud, collaborate with others, and track changes to your code.</p> <p>Over the years GitHub has become synonymous with developers, with so many new features added in, GitHub goes beyond simply hosting Git repositories. It has several other features such as collaboration, codespaces (Virtual Machines), web hosting, and much more.</p>"},{"location":"workshop/#getting-started","title":"Getting Started","text":"<p>If you are using your local machine you can follow the instructions on this page to install git. There are a few more steps to get your account details setup, but for today we are going to use GitHub's web interface to get started.</p> <p>GitHub offers free access to a computer on the cloud, a feature known as GitHub codespaces. This is a great way to get started with coding and GitHub without having to install anything on your local machine. You can access it by clicking on the <code>.</code> key on any repository or selecting <code>Codespaces</code> on GitHub.</p> <p>You will need to have or create a GitHub account to use GitHub Codespaces. If you don't have one, you can create one here. Please use your college email which will be useful for next steps.</p> <p>Thanks to codespaces we will skip a lot of setup steps and get straight to the cool stuff.

You can use git on your local machine without ever needing to create a GitHub account. However, if you want to collaborate with others, or store your code on GitHub, you will need a GitHub account.
