## 🚀 Local Deployment Guidelines

Any changes to the markdown files of this repository will be simple and deploying locally to verify should not be necessary. But if you're a techie and want to get your hands dirty, below is an outline of the tech stack we use to convert the markdown files into a pretty website!

We use [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) to generate our webpage. You can test any changes by locally using the command `mkdocs serve`. Detailed information on installing mkdocs is available [here](https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/).

We also make use of the [material theme](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/). Installation instructions are available [here](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/)

Both are easily installed with pip.
